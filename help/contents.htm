<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Proxima Controller is
  an application that allows you to use the mouse and computer keyboard to play
  external MIDI devices such as synthesizers and tone generators. It is also possible
  to play internal devices if they are designed to respond to MIDI messages (for
  example, the Microsoft GS Wavetable SW Synth). This application makes no sounds
  of its own and instead relies on the MIDI devices it is controlling to produce
  sound. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The interface is simple
  and straightforward and should require very little explanation.</font></p>
<!--<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Bank control lets you
  select which patch bank to use. This will generally not have any effect on older
  MIDI devices or on devices that have an internal memory of less than 128 patches.
  Values range from 1 to 128.</font></p>-->
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Patch control lets you
  select the patch to use. This is also sometimes referred to as the program or
  the instrument. Values range from 1 to 128.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The MIDI Channel control
  lets you set which MIDI channel data will be transmitted on. The default is
  channel 1 and values range from 1 to 16.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The MIDI Device selection
  box lets you choose which MIDI device to transmit data on. The &quot;MIDI Mapper&quot;
  device will cause the program to use the device that is set to handle MIDI music
  playback in the &quot;Sounds and Audio Devices&quot; section of your system's
  control panel. Other selections will use the device that has been selected.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The button showing an exclamation
  point is a &quot;panic button&quot;. Clicking this button will turn off all
  notes and reset all controllers. This can be useful if you get a stuck note
  or some bad MIDI data.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The button showing the letter
  &quot;i&quot; is the &quot;info button&quot;. It shows the about box.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you're reading this you've
  probably figured out what the button showing the question mark does.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The left slider is the &quot;pitch
  wheel&quot;. It can be clicked and dragged up or down to raise or lower the
  pitch of any notes that are playing. When released it will return to zero position
  (center).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The right slider is the
  &quot;modulation wheel&quot;. It can be clicked and dragged up to increase the
  modulation setting. When released it will stay where it was left. When the slider
  is at the bottom of its range of travel it is considered to be at zero position.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The remainder of the program
  is a set of 5 octaves of keys. These can be clicked individually with the mouse
  or activated using the computer keyboard. When a note is on, the key will show
  a red dot. For keyboard control, the lowest octave is triggered by the function
  keys and each higher octave is controlled by the next row of keys, the bottom
  row being the highest octave.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That's all there is to it.
  Enjoy :)</font></p>
